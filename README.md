# Weather Trends Analysis

This was an introductory project required by Udacity , where I analyzed local and global temperature data to answer the following questions: Is my city hotter or cooler than the average global temperature?  Does my city temperature have the same trend as the global temperature? Finally, is the global temperature increasing, decreasing, or staying the same over the years?<br>

For querying the data, I used the SQL workspace provided in the class, and Microsoft Excel to calculate the simple moving average, which helped me answering my preliminary questions. <br>

The datasets were provided by Udacity , where I downloaded and saved to my local space. I copied and pasted the codes and their outputs to a word document. The final product is PDF file, which I uploaded to `weather-trends-analysis` repository.
